Kangaroo
========

Kangaroo is an OpenObject client/wrapper for Rails 3, based on ActiveModel. It provides CRUD access to OpenERP objects via XMLRPC.
It's fast, provides default data for new objects and basic validations (for required fields etc), as well as a simple ARel like
query syntax and (not yet fully, but it's coming) associations. This is pre-pre-alpha ;).
